What is Pazuzu?
---------------

Pazuzu is a tool that builds Docker images from feature snippets, while
resolving all dependencies between them. One of the common use cases is
Continuous Integration environment, where jobs require specific tooling present
for building and testing. Pazuzu can significantly ease that process, by letting user
choose from a wide selection of predefined Dockerfile snippets that represent
those dependencies (e.g. Golang, Python, Android SDK, customized NPM installs).

What is Pazuzu UI?
------------------
